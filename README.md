# odin-landing-page
This project is part of Flexbox series on 'The Odin Project'. I decided to design my landing page around what I have learnt so far on this journey.

The key takeaways from this project are:
- Using HTML to structure my website via the use of appropriate tags to create the necessary elements. Elements were organised by assigning selector classes and IDs in ordered to be targeted later for styling purposes
- CSS was used to enhanced the visual representation through styling attributes and positioning. 
- GIT is an essential version control system to track changes to files. Writing a good commit message and following basic principles such as using imperative mood in the subject line is crucial to both individual and collaborative environments.  
- The best way to learn is through practice. I intend to revisit and refine the code in this project to apply optimisations and fix workflow errors. 

Thanks for stopping by!
